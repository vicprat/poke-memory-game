Poke Memory

Using the API https://pokeapi.co, you should write a React App that behaves like the Memory (Pairs/Matching Pairs) game but using Pokemons for the cards.


Functional requirements:

Fetch 5 random pokemons from the Poke API
Create 10 Cards, and randomly create the position for every pokemon on each card (each pokemon will be in 2 cards), the card should contain the pokemon's image.
Emulate the behavior of the original game
Show a message of win if the player can find all the pairs without 5 fails
If the player fails 5 times, show a message of fail/game over.
If the player wins, he should have the option to select any pokemon he was playing with and see the details of that pokemon on a new view


Non functional requirements:

App must be developed in React
App must use Redux
App must use a router library (like react-dom-router)


Nice to have:

Test (unit test, integration test, e2e test, any of these)
Typescript


After you finish, please upload the project to a public repository and paste the url here.
